# config

A repository in which I store configuration files and scripts for my personal computers. Currently I am nearly only using macOS so the Windows config might be a bit outdated.

## ðŸ—‚ Dot-Files
One reason for this repository are my dot-files in my home directory. To setup these files just run the [setup_home.sh](https://github.com/redii/config/blob/main/macos/setup_home.sh) script. My dot-files can be found in [here](https://github.com/redii/config/blob/main/macos/home).

## ðŸ›  Installed software

The main reason for this repository was to save my installed programs to be able to simply reinstall them whenever I get new hardware. All programs I use regulary can be found in the [install_software.sh](https://github.com/redii/config/blob/main/macos/install_software.sh) file. Just run the script and everything needed gets installed.
